In this project, we visualize the US GDP data using a bar chart. The data is obtained from [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json). The bar chart provides a clear representation of the GDP growth over time from 1947 to 2015, allowing users to easily analyze and interpret the data.
